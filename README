export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/casperjs/bin:$(pwd)/phantomjs/bin

Running maps_directions.js with capser manually

casperjs maps_directions.js "some start location" "some end location"
Will produce directions.png with just the snippet of the top left of the google map with directions that shows time and distance

Run the makemaps.py

Just run makemaps.py
It will create a maps_DD_MM_YYYY_HH_MM directory and put an image of each of the commute times called directions_#.png where the # is the index of the item in the makemaps.py end tuple(1-indexed)
Then it will put all commute times in a nice csv file named DD_MM_YYYY_HH_MM.csv
